## Code for ACP Tutorial 1

A basic service that will allow the user to perform actions regarding registering ACP students for class. The registered students will be placed into BLOB storage. 

I have included an env.env file here and hardcoded the environment variables into the Dockerfile (please do not do this normally) this is just to to save time when it comes to cloning and getting the service up and running :)
